/**
 * @whatItDoes
 *
 * *Part of the [upgrade/static](/docs/ts/latest/api/#!?query=upgrade%2Fstatic)
 * library for hybrid upgrade apps that support AoT compilation*
 *
 * Allows an Angular component to be used from AngularJS.
 *
 * @howToUse
 *
 * Let's assume that you have an Angular component called `ng2Heroes` that needs
 * to be made available in AngularJS templates.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="ng2-heroes"}
 *
 * We must create an AngularJS [directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)
 * that will make this Angular component available inside AngularJS templates.
 * The `downgradeComponent()` function returns a factory function that we
 * can use to define the AngularJS directive that wraps the "downgraded" component.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="ng2-heroes-wrapper"}
 *
 * @description
 *
 * A helper function that returns a factory function to be used for registering an
 * AngularJS wrapper directive for "downgrading" an Angular component.
 *
 * The parameter contains information about the Component that is being downgraded:
 *
 * * `component: Type<any>`: The type of the Component that will be downgraded
 *
 * @experimental
