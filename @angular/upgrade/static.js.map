Creation of an Angular directive that wraps and exposes an AngularJS component so\n *    that it can be used in an Angular template. See {@link UpgradeComponent}.\n * 2. Creation of an AngularJS directive that wraps and exposes an Angular component so\n *    that it can be used in an AngularJS template. See {@link downgradeComponent}.\n * 3. Creation of an Angular root injector provider that wraps and exposes an AngularJS\n *    service so that it can be injected into an Angular context. See\n *    {@link UpgradeModule#upgrading-an-angular-1-service Upgrading an AngularJS service} below.\n * 4. Creation of an AngularJS service that wraps and exposes an Angular injectable\n *    so that it can be injected into an AngularJS context. See {@link downgradeInjectable}.\n * 3. Bootstrapping of a hybrid Angular application which contains both of the frameworks\n *    coexisting in a single application. See the\n *    {@link UpgradeModule#example example} below.\n *\n * ## Mental Model\n *\n * When reasoning about how a hybrid application works it is useful to have a mental model which\n * describes what is happening and explains what is happening at the lowest level.\n *\n * 1. There are two independent frameworks running in a single application, each framework treats\n *    the other as a black box.\n * 2. Each DOM element on the page is owned exactly by one framework. Whichever framework\n *    instantiated the element is the owner. Each framework only updates/interacts with its own\n *    DOM elements and ignores others.\n * 3. AngularJS directives always execute inside the AngularJS framework codebase regardless of\n *    where they are instantiated.\n * 4. Angular components always execute inside the Angular framework codebase regardless of\n *    where they are instantiated.\n * 5. An AngularJS component can be \"upgraded\"\" to an Angular component. This is achieved by\n *    defining an Angular directive, which bootstraps the AngularJS component at its location\n *    in the DOM. See {@link UpgradeComponent}.\n * 6. An Angular component can be \"downgraded\"\" to an AngularJS component. This is achieved by\n *    defining an AngularJS directive, which bootstraps the Angular component at its location\n *    in the DOM. See {@link downgradeComponent}.\n * 7. Whenever an \"upgraded\"/\"downgraded\" component is instantiated the host element is owned by\n *    the framework doing the instantiation. The other framework then instantiates and owns the\n *    view for that component.\n *    a. This implies that the component bindings will always follow the semantics of the\n *       instantiation framework.\n *    b. The DOM attributes are parsed by the framework that owns the current template. So\n * attributes\n *       in AngularJS templates must use kebab-case, while AngularJS templates must use camelCase.\n *    c. However the template binding syntax will always use the Angular style, e.g. square\n *       brackets (`[...]`) for property binding.\n * 8. AngularJS is always bootstrapped first and owns the root component.\n * 9. The new application is running in an Angular zone, and therefore it no longer needs calls\n * to\n *    `$apply()`.\n *\n * @howToUse\n *\n * `import {UpgradeModule} from '@angular/upgrade/static';`\n *\n * ## Example\n * Import the {@link UpgradeModule} into your top level {@link NgModule Angular `NgModule`}.\n *\n * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region='ng2-module'}\n *\n * Then bootstrap the hybrid upgrade app's module, get hold of the {@link UpgradeModule} instance\n * and use it to bootstrap the top level [AngularJS\n * module](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/angular.Module).\n *\n * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region='bootstrap'}\n *\n *\n * ## Upgrading an AngularJS service\n *\n * There is no specific API for upgrading an AngularJS service. Instead you should just follow the\n * following recipe:\n *\n * Let's say you have an AngularJS service:\n *\n * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region=\"ng1-title-case-service\"}\n *\n * Then you should define an Angular provider to be included in your {@link NgModule} `providers`\n * property.\n *\n * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region=\"upgrade-ng1-service\"}\n *\n * Then you can use the \"upgraded\" AngularJS service by injecting it into an Angular component\n * or service.\n *\n * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region=\"use-ng1-upgraded-service\"}\n *\n * @description\n *\n * This class is an `NgModule`, which you import to provide AngularJS core services,\n * and has an instance method used to bootstrap the hybrid upgrade application.\n *\n * ## Core AngularJS services\n * Importing this {@link NgModule} will add providers for the core\n * [AngularJS services](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service) to the root injector.\n *\n * ## Bootstrap\n * The runtime instance of this class contains a {@link UpgradeModule#bootstrap `bootstrap()`}\n * method, which you use to bootstrap the top level AngularJS module onto an element in the\n * DOM for the hybrid upgrade app.\n *\n * It also contains properties to access the {@link UpgradeModule#injector root injector}, the\n * bootstrap {@link NgZone} and the\n * [AngularJS $injector](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/auto/service/$injector).\n *\n * @experimental\n */\n\nexport class UpgradeModule {\n  /**\n   * The AngularJS `$injector` for the upgrade application.\n   */\n  public $injector: any /*angular.IInjectorService*/;\n\n  constructor(\n      /** The root {@link Injector} for the upgrade application. */\n      public injector: Injector,\n      /** The bootstrap zone for the upgrade application */\n      public ngZone: NgZone) {}\n\n  /**\n   * Bootstrap an AngularJS application from this NgModule\n   * @param element the element on which to bootstrap the AngularJS application\n   * @param [modules] the AngularJS modules to bootstrap for this application\n   * @param [config] optional extra AngularJS bootstrap configuration\n   */\n  bootstrap(\n      element: Element, modules: string[] = [], config?: any /*angular.IAngularBootstrapConfig*/) {\n    const INIT_MODULE_NAME = UPGRADE_MODULE_NAME + '.init';\n\n    // Create an ng1 module to bootstrap\n    const initModule =\n        angular\n            .module(INIT_MODULE_NAME, [])\n\n            .value(INJECTOR_KEY, this.injector)\n\n            .config([\n              $PROVIDE, $INJECTOR,\n              ($provide: angular.IProvideService, $injector: angular.IInjectorService) => {\n                if ($injector.has($$TESTABILITY)) {\n                  $provide.decorator($$TESTABILITY, [\n                    $DELEGATE,\n                    (testabilityDelegate: angular.ITestabilityService) => {\n                      const originalWhenStable: Function = testabilityDelegate.whenStable;\n                      const injector = this.injector;\n                      // Cannot use arrow function below because we need the context\n                      const newWhenStable = function(callback: Function) {\n                        originalWhenStable.call(testabilityDelegate, function() {\n                          const ng2Testability: Testability = injector.get(Testability);\n                          if (ng2Testability.isStable()) {\n                            callback();\n                          } else {\n                            ng2Testability.whenStable(\n                                newWhenStable.bind(testabilityDelegate, callback));\n                          }\n                        });\n                      };\n\n                      testabilityDelegate.whenStable = newWhenStable;\n                      return testabilityDelegate;\n                    }\n                  ]);\n                }\n              }\n            ])\n\n            .run([\n              $INJECTOR,\n              ($injector: angular.IInjectorService) => {\n                this.$injector = $injector;\n\n                // Initialize the ng1 $injector provider\n                setTempInjectorRef($injector);\n                this.injector.get($INJECTOR);\n\n                // Put the injector on the DOM, so that it can be \"required\"\n                angular.element(element).data(controllerKey(INJECTOR_KEY), this.injector);\n\n                // Wire up the ng1 rootScope to run a digest cycle whenever the zone settles\n                // We need to do this in the next tick so that we don't prevent the bootup\n                // stabilizing\n                setTimeout(() => {\n                  const $rootScope = $injector.get('$rootScope');\n                  const subscription =\n                      this.ngZone.onMicrotaskEmpty.subscribe(() => $rootScope.$digest());\n                  $rootScope.$on('$destroy', () => { subscription.unsubscribe();
