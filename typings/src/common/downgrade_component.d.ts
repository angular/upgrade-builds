/**
 * @whatItDoes
 *
 * *Part of the [upgrade/static](/docs/ts/latest/api/#!?query=upgrade%2Fstatic)
 * library for hybrid upgrade apps that support AoT compilation*
 *
 * Allows an Angular component to be used from AngularJS.
 *
 * @howToUse
 *
 * Let's assume that you have an Angular component called `ng2Heroes` that needs
 * to be made available in AngularJS templates.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="ng2-heroes"}
 *
 * We must create an AngularJS [directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)
 * that will make this Angular component available inside AngularJS templates.
 * The `downgradeComponent()` function returns a factory function that we
 * can use to define the AngularJS directive that wraps the "downgraded" component.
 *
 * {@example upgrade/static/ts/module.ts region="ng2-heroes-wrapper"}
 *
 * In this example you can see that we must provide information about the component being
 * "downgraded". This is because once the AoT compiler has run, all metadata about the
 * component has been removed from the code, and so cannot be inferred.
 *
 * We must do the following:
 * * specify the Angular component class that is to be downgraded
 * * specify all inputs and outputs that the AngularJS component expects
 * * specify the selectors used in any `ng-content` elements in the component's template
 *
 * @description
 *
 * A helper function that returns a factory function to be used for registering an
 * AngularJS wrapper directive for "downgrading" an Angular component.
 *
 * The parameter contains information about the Component that is being downgraded:
 *
 * * `component: Type<any>`: The type of the Component that will be downgraded
 * * `inputs: string[]`: A collection of strings that specify what inputs the component accepts
 * * `outputs: string[]`: A collection of strings that specify what outputs the component emits
 * * `selectors: string[]`: A collection of strings that specify what selectors are expected on
 *   `ng-content` elements in the template to enable content projection (a.k.a. transclusion in
 *   AngularJS)
 *
 * The `inputs` and `outputs` are strings that map the names of properties to camelCased
 * attribute names. They are of the form `"prop: attr"`; or simply `"propAndAttr" where the
 * property and attribute have the same identifier.
 *
 * The `selectors` are the values of the `select` attribute of each of the `ng-content` elements
 * that appear in the downgraded component's template.
 * These selectors must be provided in the order that they appear in the template as they are
 * mapped by index to the projected nodes.
 *
 * @experimental
